The NameSorter program alphabetizes the contents of a given text file.
The main function creates two file references, one for the input and one for the output. The input file is read and turned into an array list for sorting purposes.
The collection is then sorted, and the now sorted array list gets converted back to a file and written to disk, with some added information like the total number of names.
