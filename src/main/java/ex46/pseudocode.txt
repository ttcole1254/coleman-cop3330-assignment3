The WordFrequencyFinder program checks how often a given word appears within a file. The file is read into an array list, and then each word is added to a hashmap with it's count.
For every word, it checks the hashmap first to see if it already exists. If it does, it will increment the count for that word. If not, it will add the word to the hashmap with the count of 1.
Once the file is processed, it sorts the hashmap by the number of counts, highest on top. It then prints the results on the screen by using asterisks as count indicators.
