The Parsing function reads a CSV file, sorts by salary highest to lowest, and writes the results to disk.
The main function creates two file references, one for the input and one for the output. The input file is read and turned into an array list for sorting purposes.
The fileWrite method splits each line based on a single character, in this case a comma. This is the simplest way of doing this as the split values are not saved, and simply printed as they are split.
Each line is read one at a time for easy parsing.
