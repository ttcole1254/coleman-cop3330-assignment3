The WebsiteGenerator program creates a website skeleton based on user input and known variables. It begins by asking the site's name, author, whether you want a JavaScript folder, and whether you want a CSS folder.
It adds these answers to an array list, and passes it to a method which creates the paths for all of the files and folders.
The pathMaker function uses a switch case to determine which answer it's currently looking at. It then sends a request to another function to create an HTML file with the requested author and website name.
It also creates the main website directory, and supporting directories if requested.
Separate functions take care of each operation separately, from creating a folder, a file, and adding the code to the HTML file.
